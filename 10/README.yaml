    description: >-
      A recommended way to start up your MariaDB server is to have the root
      password generated as a onetime password. You will then log on and
      change this password. MariaDB will not fully function until this onetime
      password is changed.

  - name: MARAIDB_USER
    description: >-
      Optionally specifies a new user to be created at startup.
      Must be used in conjunction with `MARAIDB_PASSWORD`. Note that this
      user is in addition to the default `root` superuser.
      <br><br>
      If `MARAIDB_DATABASE` is also specified, this user will be granted
      superuser permissions (i.e. `GRANT_ALL`) for that database.
